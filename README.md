# Vue-PageBuilder
1. This repository is a prototype I am building that will enable me to build out a full page builder in VueJS, with comparable features to my other repository "PortalCMS", but on a modern JS stack.
2. View a brief video of my progress so far here - https://youtu.be/Iwwv0A7ttpQ
3. The end goal is to have a full set of components to render a website that "looks nice", it has to support two way syncing.
4. Ideally data is fetched and posted to a resful API upon sync changes.
5. It would be great to build another front end in another platform to prove that the JSON isn't platform specific too.
